# Collaborative Soft Robotics Simulation

This project explores how collaboration between multiple soft robots can enhance their overall mechanical performance, compensating for individual limitations in force and flexibility. The work includes a presentation of the system design, simulation approach using the SOFA framework, and analysis of coordinated behavior versus isolated performance.

üõ†Ô∏è **Framework:** SOFA (Soft Robotics Simulation)

This project was developed as part of a team academic assignment at IMT Atlantique.

**Note:** Only the final presentation is included in this repository. Simulation files were developed collaboratively and are not individually owned.
